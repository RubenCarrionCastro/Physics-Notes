This folder contains my personal study notes and solved exercises for the course Quantum Field Theory, completed during my SICUE exchange year at the University of Granada (2024–2025).

The material is fully written by me, following standard references (Tong, Schwartz, Maggiore, Peskin, Weinberg) and class lectures. All problem statements have been rephrased to avoid copyrighted material.

📚 Contents
1. Lecture Notes (notes/ or main.tex)
A complete set of notes covering the core topics of Quantum Field Thoery:

Introduction. Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. Particles and Fields.
Classical field theory.
Quantization of free fields.
Field interactions. S matrix and Feynman rules.
Observables: cross sections and decay widths.
Quantum Electrodynamics. Elementary processes at tree level.
Gauge theories and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Standard Model.

📝 2. Solved Exercises (exercises/)
The exercises/ folder contains solved problems using both analytic derivations and symbolic computation tools.

Each exercise is placed into its own subfolder
