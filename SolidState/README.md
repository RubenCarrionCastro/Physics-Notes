# Solid State Physics – Study Notes and Solved Problems

This folder contains my personal study notes and solved exercises for the 
course *Solid State*, completed at the 
University of Córdoba (2025–2026).

The material is fully written by me, following standard references 
(Pávlov, Ashcroft, Kittel, Omar, Sholl) and class lectures.

The notes are self-contained and written from scratch in LaTeX.
