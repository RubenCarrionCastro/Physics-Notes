# Quantum Mechanics – Study Notes and Solved Problems

This folder contains my personal study notes and solved exercises for the 
course *Quantum Mechanics*, completed during my SICUE exchange year at the 
University of Granada (2024–2025).

The material is fully written by me, following standard references 
(Weinberg, Sakurai, Taylor, Ballentine) and class lectures. All problem statements have been 
rephrased to avoid copyrighted material.
