# General Relativity – Study Notes and Solved Problems

This folder contains my personal study notes and solved exercises for the 
course *General Relativity*, completed during my SICUE exchange year at the 
University of Granada (2024–2025).

The material is fully written by me, following standard references 
(Wald, Carroll, Schutz) and class lectures. All problem statements have been 
rephrased to avoid copyrighted material.

## 📚 Contents

### **1. Lecture Notes (`notes/` or `main.tex`)**
A complete set of notes covering the core topics of General Relativity:

- Tensor analysis and index notation  
- Covariant derivatives and Christoffel symbols  
- Geodesics and variational principle  
- Curvature tensors: Riemann, Ricci and scalar curvature  
- Einstein Field Equations  
- Energy–momentum tensor and matter models  
- Schwarzschild geometry and its properties  
- Weak field limit and Newtonian correspondence  
- Additional worked examples and derivations  

The notes are self-contained and written from scratch in LaTeX.

## 📝 2. **Solved Exercises (`exercises/`)**

The `exercises/` folder contains solved problems using both analytic 
derivations and symbolic computation tools.

Each exercise is placed into its own subfolder:
