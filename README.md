# Physics Notes – Rubén Carrión Castro

This repository contains my personal LaTeX study notes, solved exercises, and 
computational projects developed throughout my Physics degree at the 
University of Córdoba (Spain) and during my SICUE exchange year at the 
University of Granada (2024–2025).

The material here reflects my academic interests in:
- Theoretical Physics  
- General Relativity  
- Quantum Field Theory  
- Computational Physics  
- Mathematical Methods for Physics  

All notes and solutions are written entirely by me. Problem statements are 
paraphrased to avoid copyrighted material.

Each subject folder contains:
- `main.tex` or modular `.tex` files  
- PDF notes  
- Solved exercises in subfolders  
- A dedicated `README.md`
