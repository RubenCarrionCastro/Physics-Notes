# Statistical Mechanics – Study Notes and Solved Problems

This folder contains my personal study notes and solved exercises for the 
course *Statistical Mechanics*, completed at the 
University of Córdoba (2023–2024) and the exercises are from my SICUE at the University of Granada (2024-2025).

The material is fully written by me, following standard references 
(Brey, Pathria, Landau) and class lectures. All problem statements have been 
rephrased to avoid copyrighted material.
